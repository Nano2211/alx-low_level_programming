This project looks to explain memory allocation for programms using dynamic memory allocation for programs
This project contains 7 tasks
task 0: Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.



Prototype: char *create_array(unsigned int size, char c);

Returns NULL if size = 0

Returns a pointer to the array, or NULL
task 1: Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
task 2:Write a function that concatenates two strings.
task 3:Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
task 4:Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
